## Design Patterns
DAO - This is a structural pattern that alows developer to separate the business layer from the persistence layer(database mainly) with the help of API. DAO is basically an abstract API that perform CRUD operations on any type(<T>) object.

In repository pattern we can only deal with one table per class.Moreover, it is the abstraction of collection of objects.
