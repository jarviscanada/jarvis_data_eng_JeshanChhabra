# Jeshan Chhabra . Jarvis Consulting

I graduated from Georgian College with a Computer Programming Diploma. Currently, I am employed as a Software Developer at Jarvis Consulting Group where I have worked on various technologies like Java, Spring Boot, and SQL and got familiar with real-world industry standards. My passion for programming made me a good-problem solver which has helped me to fabricate efficient solutions that are robust, maintainable, and scalable. Throughout my studies, I have worked on numerous languages and frameworks such as Java, SQL, Linux, Docker, Git, RDMS, and many more. I have also developed Full-stack applications with REST APIs along with Desktop applications. I am experienced in working in teams which made me a more responsible continuous learner, and a good team player. My passion for programming made me a quick learner and always motivated me in creating unique and creative solutions to any client problem.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JeshanChhabra](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JeshanChhabra)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JeshanChhabra/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a Linux cluster monitoring tool that monitor's the hardware specifications and usage of each server in the cluster. Used bash scripts and SQL queries to get the desired information that persisted in the containerized PostgreSQL database instance. Constant information gets stored in the database with the help of the crontab job that was used for the automation.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JeshanChhabra/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: Developed a command-line client to interact with the Twitter REST API. The application is capable of doing CRUD operations from a user's Twitter account. Used Twitter REST API and HTTP client for communication. The solution is implemented using JAVA, Spring framework for dependency management, build using Maven, and is deployed to Docker. JUnit and Mockito were used to test the application so that everything adhere to desired specifications.
  - JDBC App: Developed an application that used the JDBC API to connect java code with the containerized PostgreSQL database instance.Implemented CRUD operations on DAO's having predefined SQL queries.
  - Grep App: Developed the Linux grep command line utility in Java that searches recursively for the given pattern in the files and sub directories. Used lamdas and Java Streams to effectively process large files using a limited amount of memory. The application is packaged using Maven and is deployed in the Docker hub..

**Springboot App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JeshanChhabra/tree/master/springboot)]: Developing a proof-of-concept that allow users to manage accounts, quotes, and fetch stock information from IEX Cloud. All the components are written in Java, Spring Framework for dependency management, and Apache Tomcat is used as a WebServlet. IEX Cloud APIs were used to retrieve the latest stock information and the data is persisted in containerized PostgreSQL database. Tested the application manually and with the JUnit so that it performs as per the pre-defined business idea. It is managed by Maven and is deployed to Docker Hub.


## Highlighted Projects
**Network-PC Comparison** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jeshan26/Network_Pc_Comparison)]: Developed an desktop application(GUI) that was used to control any system in the same network by running our own server on it. The code is wriiten in Java and the code is deployed to the Github.

**E-Commerce website**: Developed an E-Commerce website that performs CRUD Operations and is connected to Database(MongoDb). This is a frontend website that stores the users account details and share a common static page that lists all the items added. The backend is wriiten in Node.js, Handlebars(templating language) is used for the frontend and is connected to MongoDb database .
