summary: I graduated from Georgian College with a Computer Programming Diploma. Currently, I am employed as a Software Developer at Jarvis Consulting Group where I have worked on various technologies like Java, Spring Boot, and SQL and got familiar with real-world industry standards. My passion for programming made me a good-problem solver which has helped me to fabricate efficient solutions that are robust, maintainable, and scalable. Throughout my studies, I have worked on numerous languages and frameworks such as Java, SQL, Linux, Docker, Git, RDMS, and many more. I have also developed Full-stack applications with REST APIs along with Desktop applications. I am experienced in working in teams which made me a more responsible continuous learner, and a good team player. My passion for programming made me a quick learner and always motivated me in creating unique and creative solutions to any client problem.
